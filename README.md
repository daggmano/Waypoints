# Waypoints
Demonstrates the following features:

1. Display standard Google Map, initially centered on Adelaide, South Australia.
2. Using toolbar menu option, demonstrate use of TileOverlays to toggle between standard Google map and an abstract watercolour map (http://maps.stamen.com/)
3. Allow waypoints to be added by tapping the map. Possible selections are displayed based on a Google Places search, utilising option selection in preferences.
4. Distances between start and end waypoints is displayed and markers placed on waylines based on unit selection in preferences.
5. Clicking a waypoint displays details of the selected point and allows deletion.
6. Waypoints may be reordered and deleted from a separate screen (accessible via toolbar menu item).  Swipe to delete, long-click and drag to reorder.
7. Waypoints may be inserted by long-clicking on a wayline.  The newly inserted point may then (via a long-click-drag) be dragged to a new location. (Note: this can be tricky...)
